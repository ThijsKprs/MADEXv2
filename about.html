                        <p>These photographs explore the boundary between recognition and abstraction. By moving in extremely close to everyday objects, their familiar forms dissolve into patterns, textures, and rhythms. What we see at first glance no longer tells us what the object is, but invites us to simply look.</p>
                        <p>Up close, reality becomes almost unrecognizable: surfaces turn into landscapes, materials into visual compositions. This shift in perspective reminds us that the world around us is filled with unnoticed details, structures, and beauty that often remain invisible at a distance.</p>
                        <p>Through these images, I invite you to slow down and question perception. What seems abstract is entirely real, and what appears ordinary can, when viewed closely, become something unexpected.</p>
